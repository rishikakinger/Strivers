//a heap is a complete binary tree that follows certain properties 

//complete binary tree- every level is completely filled except last
//and nodes are always added from left 

//types of heaps: maxheap and minheap
//maxheap-max heap is at root
//minheap-min is always at root


//implementation: in the form of an array
//if the node is at ith index, left child is always at 2*ith index
//right child will always be at 2*i+1th index


//parent of any node is at i/2th index
