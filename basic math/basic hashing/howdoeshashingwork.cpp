//only division method covered here

//each hash key maps to only 1 no in the original array-- dont get confused 
//chainign using linked list in case of collisions- chained in sorted order

//worst case is when all your keys end up in the same hash index 

//NOTE: in a map, ANY kind of datatype can be a key, but in unordered map, only individual data types
