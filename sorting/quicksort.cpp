// similar time complexity as merge sort, but doesnt use any extra array
// i.e it is an in-place algorithm!

// step1: given an array, pick a pivot element(can be any element)
// doesnt matter as youre placing it in its correct pos
// use the rule:smaller on the left, larger on the right
// take all smaller elements, put them on left; take all larger elements, put on right
//  repeat for all pivots
